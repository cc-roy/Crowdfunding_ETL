# Crowdfunding_ETL

The 'ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code_...' file ingests data from the crowdfunding and contacts xlsx files located within the 'Resources' directory, transforms them, and wrties them to the campaign, category, contacts, and subcategory csvs located in the 'Resources' directory.

The 'erd_text.txt' file contains the plain text code that was used to generate the 'erd-viz.png' file as well as the 'crowdfunding_db_schema.sql' file via https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com.

The sql code contained within the 'crowdfunding_db_schema.sql' file was used to generate tables within a local Postgres SQL data base, with the csvs mentioned earlier used to populate the respective tables. The campaign_query, category_query, contacts_query, and subcategory_query png files are screenshots that show the creation of the Postgres DB.
